1. 📖 Overview
NextInno Labs presents MoonKnight, a modular ISP Management System designed for scalable and efficient ISP management. Developed using .NET 7 with a microservice architecture, MoonKnight includes multi-tenant authentication, customer & billing management, network configuration, ticketing, and detailed analytics. Each microservice operates independently with isolated databases and communicates via REST APIs, enabling flexibility and scalability.

👥 MoonKnight.Clients	Customer onboarding, KYC, profile management
💳 MoonKnight.Billing	Package assignment, invoicing, payment gateway integration
📡 MoonKnight.Network	Network package management, IP allocation, Radius support
🎫 MoonKnight.Support	Ticketing, technician assignment, SLA management
